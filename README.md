## ⚙️ Technology Stack

This project leverages a modern backend technology stack to ensure performance, scalability, and ease of development. Below is a breakdown of the core technologies used and their roles in the project.

### 🐍 Django

A high-level web framework built with Python, designed to simplify the development of secure, scalable, and maintainable web applications. 
**Purpose**: Manages core backend functionality, including URL routing, database interactions, business logic, and built-in admin features.

### 🧰 Django REST Framework (DRF)

A robust and flexible library built on Django that simplifies the building of RESTful APIs.
**Purpose**: Powers the RESTful API endpoints that handle core functionalities such as user accounts, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews.

### 🐘 PostgreSQL

A reliable and feature-rich open-source relational database system designed for scalability and data integrity.
**Purpose**: Manages structured data including user accounts, property listings, bookings, and payment information.

### 🔍 GraphQL

An API query language that enables clients to retrieve precisely the data they require, reducing over-fetching and improving efficiency.
**Purpose**: Provides flexible and efficient data retrieval by allowing clients to request exactly the data they need, minimizing over-fetching and under-fetching.

### 📦 Celery

A distributed task queue that handles asynchronous and scheduled tasks in the background.
**Purpose**: Handles background tasks like sending email notifications and processing payments.

### ⚡ Redis

An in-memory data structure store used for caching and message brokering, enabling fast data access and efficient communication between services.
**Purpose**: Stores session data, accelerates database performance through caching, and serves as a message broker for background task processing with Celery.

### 🐳 Docker
A containerization platform that enables developers to package applications and their dependencies into isolated containers, ensuring consistent environments across development, testing, and production.  
**Purpose**: Provides consistent development and deployment environments for the backend stack.

### 🔁 Docker Compose

Tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications using a simple YAML configuration.
**Purpose**: Orchestrates multiple services like Django, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Redis with a single command.

### 🔄 Celery

An asynchronous task queue used to run background jobs, enabling non-blocking operations like sending emails or processing payments.
**Purpose**: Automates recurring tasks like clearing expired sessions, sending reminders, or handling scheduled operations.

### 🔬 Pytest

A lightweight and powerful testing framework for writing simple and scalable tests in Python applications. 
**Purpose**: Enables thorough unit and integration testing to ensure system reliability.

### 📬 Postman

Tool for testing, documenting, and monitoring APIs in development.
**Purpose**: To test and validate RESTful API endpoints throughout development.


### 🔧 CI/CD Pipelines

Automated workflows that streamline the process of building, testing, and deploying code with speed and reliability. 
**Purpose**: Ensures code changes are validated and deployed efficiently and reliably.
